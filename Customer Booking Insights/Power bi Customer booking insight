📊 Project Overview: Customer Bookings & Visa Applications – Switzerland Focus
This Power BI project analyzes customer bookings and visa application trends, with a focus on Switzerland. It brings together data on:

🛂 Visa Applications – status, processing time, and fees

🧍 Customer Behavior – gender, country, and demand patterns

🏨 Hotel & Ticket Reservations – cost, location, and travel flow
I used DAX calculations, interactive visuals, and custom icons to enhance clarity and engagement. 
The project allows users to explore reservation patterns, visa demand, and overall customer behavior in one place.
