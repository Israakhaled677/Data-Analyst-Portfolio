Recently, I decided to work on a project out of pure curiosity and passion, as someone working in HR / Talent Acquisition.

I asked myself:
“Why not explore how the AI job market is evolving? What roles are in demand? What skills are employers looking for? And what changes are happening globally?”

So, I started collecting AI job ads data from different countries…
Comparing them… observing patterns… and extracting insights that could genuinely help professionals in the field.

Here are the key insights I found:

📌 Top Paying Country
Switzerland ranked as the highest-paying country in terms of average salary for AI roles.

📌 Most Demanded Job Title
The most frequently mentioned job title was:

This highlights how critical and in-demand research roles remain worldwide.

📌 Top Required Skill
No debate here—
Python is the #1 required skill across almost all job ads and countries.

📌 Highest Remote Ratio
Australia ranked highest in terms of the percentage of AI roles offering remote work.

📌 Education Requirements
In countries like Australia—and especially in AI research roles—the demand for Master’s and PhD degrees is noticeably higher.

📌 AI Hiring Trends
There are clear spikes in AI job postings during certain months, which is highly valuable for anyone planning their next career move.

🔍 The Big Picture:
The market is moving fast…
And the data clearly shows that AI is not just a trend—it’s a booming field that increases the value of skills and opens incredible opportunities for those who continuously invest
in self-development.
